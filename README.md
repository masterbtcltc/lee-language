Lee Language

A playful phonetic twist on English where anything that sounds like “lee” proudly becomes LEE.

Lee is a light-hearted transformation system that modifies specific English word patterns to create a distinct, readable, and instantly recognizable style. It’s easy to learn, easy to extend, and simple to implement in code.

🌟 What Is Lee?

Lee is an alternate phonetic spelling system derived from English.
Its core principle is beautifully simple:

Rule 1:

If a word ends in “ly” or contains an “li” pronounced as “lee”,
it becomes “lee.”

Examples
English	Lee
legally	leegalee
definitely	definitelee
literally	literallee
clearly	clearlee

This single rule keeps Lee readable while giving every word a fun, signature look.

You can add optional rules over time to expand the language, but this repository focuses on the foundational transformation system.
